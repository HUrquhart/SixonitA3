          <h2>David Pulvirenti</h2>
          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>David Pulvirenti (Student # s3858853), was born and raised by Italian Migrant parents in Sydney. He is currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology while working full time and running an ecommerce business. He enjoys a variety of hobbies from gaming to fishing and riding motorcycles. With very little IT experience David depends on his passion for IT to drive him in his studies. His passion began when he was only a young child and a PC was brought into his household, having a PC in his life for the majority of his life has led him to feel at home when using a PC (or pretty much any
             other technological device). His current IT interest is in Web Development.</p>
