                <h2>Tools Overview Collaborative Work</h2>
                <p>For the assignment group # 3 decided to use Microsoft Teams and Google Docs instead of using the GitHub repository. Overall the two platforms worked well together and the group were effective in learning and using both software platforms. For communication the group relied on Microsoft Teams, Weekly meetings were done via MS Teams with group members using microphones to discuss and debrief assignment tasks. The MS Teams message app was also very widely used and was the primary source of communication between group members. The group also utilised the ability of MS Teams to store documents to be shared with group members. This proved a very handy feature as group members could easily upload documents for sharing purposes during conversations. Another feature we utilised which worked well in MS Teams was the share screen feature. While combining the final report we used this feature to show the current progress of the report and some other tools on each other’s screen.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the assignment was completed through Google Docs. Google Docs seemed like the easiest software platform to use as everyone already had some familiarity with the product and could easily go to the shared document to start adding their contribution. Quite often you would see multiple group members editing their sections of the document all at the same time. The ability to load the document on various devices and edit what you need then and there helped the collaborative efficiency of the team. In conjunction together both MS Teams and Google Docs worked extremely well for this project.</p>

                <h2>Overall Group Reflection / Summary</h2>
                <p>The Sixonit group were quite pleased to find that each group member had a unique attribute to offer the group to successfully complete this report and website. They found that the delegation and selection of tasks went without a hitch throughout the process and through early, proactive planning the assessment was completed within the given timeframe. Each team member met their deadlines efficiently and everyone thought that the team worked cohesively. This was in part due to great communication between group members in Microsoft Teams, excellent collaboration in Google Docs and especially due to the goal driven nature of the team.</p>
                <p>Where the team sought to grow the most was in relation to decision making. They believed that had they appointed a Project Manager to lead the team the project would have been completed with a lot more ease. They plan to nominate a Project Manager for their next project. The other hurdle the team had to overcome was the inactivity of certain team members. It was concluded that in the future the team will not sit idle for so long when a team member is unresponsive and will deal with the inactivity sooner.</p>
                <p>The team was surprised how hard it was to decide on a team name and felt as though they probably spent too long on the topic. They were pleasantly surprised by the enthusiasm of each team member to take on work and by the commitment shown by each team member.</p>
                <p>The group project amplified the importance of effective communication to each team member. It was interesting to the group how each member had a unique style of writing. It was also interesting how each team member had their own view of how a task should be completed and the consensus among the group was that clarification of tasks were essential to accurately meet the requirements of the assignment. We also learned the difficulty one faced when trying to complete a task while waiting on another team member's work.</p>
                <p>As each team member brought a distinctive skill to the group Github’s log of activity does not accurately reflect the group’s work on the assignment. The group effectively utilised each team members strengths to complete the task and the consequence of doing this is that some team members had no need to use Github, but that had no bearing on the actual work performed by that group member. The Sixonit group primarily used Google Doc’s to complete the assessment.</p>
