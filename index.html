                    <h2>Tools Overview Collaborative Work</h2>
                    <p>For the assignment group # 3 decided to use Microsoft Teams and Google Docs instead of using the GitHub repository. Overall the two platforms worked well together and the group were effective in learning and using both software platforms. For communication the group relied on Microsoft Teams, Weekly meetings were done via MS Teams with group members using microphones to discuss and debrief assignment tasks. The MS Teams message app was also very widely used and was the primary source of communication between group members. The group also utilised the ability of MS Teams to store documents to be shared with group members. This proved a very handy feature as group members could easily upload documents for sharing purposes during conversations. Another feature we utilised which worked well in MS Teams was the share screen feature. While combining the final report we used this feature to show the current progress of the report and some other tools on each other’s screen.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the assignment was completed through Google Docs. Google Docs seemed like the easiest software platform to use as everyone already had some familiarity with the product and could easily go to the shared document to start adding their contribution. Quite often you would see multiple group members editing their sections of the document all at the same time. The ability to load the document on various devices and edit what you need then and there helped the collaborative efficiency of the team. In conjunction together both MS Teams and Google Docs worked extremely well for this project.</p>

                    <h2>Overall Group Reflection / Summary</h2>
                    <p>The Sixonit group were ecstatic to find that each group member had a renewed energy about them
                       after the completion of assessment two and that the dynamics of the team flowed on from
                       assessment two. The unique attributes each team member offered in assessment two was again
                       utilised to successfully complete this report and website.</p>
                    <p>The group approached this report a little differently from assessment two and used Monday.com to
                       delegate/select tasks to facilitate the process and to also help with the tracking of the
                       project. The addition of Monday.com was a welcome one as it helped each team member in the
                       process of planning the assessment and provided clear deadlines for each members allocated
                       section. Each team member met their deadlines efficiently and everyone thought that the team
                       continued to work well together. Clear communication between group members in Microsoft Teams
                       along with excellent collaboration in Google Docs simplified the tasks and made the overwhelming
                       assessment feel relatively easy to complete on time.</p>
                    <p>With the appointment of a clear Project Manager many of the difficulties faced in assessment two
                       by the team was alleviated but that does not mean the project went without a hitch. Finding a
                       time when every team member was available to have a group chat was by far the biggest hurdle the
                       Sixonit team faced.</p>
                    <p>The team was pleasantly surprised how the team has matured over the different assessments and a
                       real rapport has developed amongst the group members. Another surprising difference was less
                       emphasis was made by the team on relatively unimportant components of the assessment and the
                       energy was spent on more important parts of the assessment. For example, less energy was needed
                       to work out the strengths and weaknesses of the team members, so the team was able to jump right
                       into the content to complete the project.</p>
                    <p>The group learnt the importance of time management when completing a group assessment and how it
                       only takes the one person to not complete their part on time to essentially put a halt to the
                       progress of the entire group.</p>
                    <p>Team Sixonit exploited each team members skillset which means that Github’s log of activity does
                       not reflect the groups work on the assessment. The Sixonit group primarily used Google Doc’s to
                       complete the assessment, Microsoft Teams to communicate throughout and Monday.com to plan and
                       monitor the progress of the assessment, all of which would be better representations of the
                       individual commitments of the members of team Sixonit.</p>

                    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                    <p>To develop the project there will not be any commercially required licencing to complete the
                       project, however physical rackspace and dedicated VPS / Bare Metal server will be required. This
                       server for data privacy reasons, will need to remain in Australia initially. This hardware will
                       allow Sixonit to deploy it’s solution to the wider internet. Harley Urquhart is an experienced
                       web developer and has worked for a collection of Australian digital media agencies and web
                       development firms.</p>
                    <p>The project will require a website that has been developed with CRON & CRUD functionality, built
                       on layers of PHP, Node.js, MySQL, AJAX, HTML, SCSS, and other technologies where required like
                       jQuery & Slim & Ken Wheelers Slick Slider.</p>
